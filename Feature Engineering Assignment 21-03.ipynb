It assigns ordinal values to categories based on their average target values.\n","\n","**How it Works:**\n","\n","1. Calculate the mean target value for each distinct category in the categorical variable.\n","2. Sort the categories in ascending order of their mean target values.\n","3. Assign ordinal values to each category based on its rank in the sorted list.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","Consider a dataset with a \"satisfaction_level\" column and a \"target_sales\" column.\n","\n","1.

Sort the categories by their mean \"target_sales\" values:\n","    - low\n","    - medium\n","    - high\n","\n","3. Assign ordinal values:\n","    - low: 1\n","    - medium: 2\n","    - high: 3\n","\n","**When to Use TGOE:**\n","\n","- Use TGOE when the categorical variable has a natural order or hierarchy, and the relationship between the categories and the target variable is important.\n","- It is particularly useful when the categories have different predictive power for the target variable.\n","- TGOE can help capture the ordinal relationship between categories and potentially improve the performance of machine learning models."],"metadata":{"id":"G2w4fjkUVgAU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q3.
